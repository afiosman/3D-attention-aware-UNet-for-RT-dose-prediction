# Attention-aware-3D-UNet-for-RT-dose-prediction
We proposed a novel KBP model using an attention-gating mechanism and on a 3D U-Net architecture for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) voxel-wise prediction for the head and neck cancer. 

# Availability of data and materials
The datasets can be found in the OpenKBP - 2020 AAPM Grand Challenge repository at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/23428.
