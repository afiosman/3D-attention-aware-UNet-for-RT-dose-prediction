# Attention-gated-3D-UNet-for-radiotherpay-dose-prediction
We proposed a novel KBP model using an attention-gating mechanism and on a 3D U-Net architecture for voxel-wise dose prediction of head and neck radiotherapy plans. 

# Availability of data and materials
The datasets can be found in the OpenKBP - 2020 AAPM Grand Challenge repository at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/23428.
