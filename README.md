# 3D-attention-aware-UNet-for-RT-dose-prediction

Deep learning-based knowledge-based planning (KBP) methods have been introduced for radiotherapy dose distribution prediction for different treatment sites to reduce the planning time and maintain consistent high-quality plans. In this study, we propose a novel KBP model using an attention-gating mechanism and a three-dimensional (3D) U-Net for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 3D dose distribution prediction in head and neck cancer.
